# Just some notes on programming

## Notes on IDE

- [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) *Free/Libre Open Source Software Binaries of VS Code*
  - Extentions for `VSCode` seem to work without any issue (but I tested just a few)
- VSCode online using GitHub:
  - browse to URL of your repository of concern and **enter `.`**
  - replace `github.com` with `github.dev` in your URL
