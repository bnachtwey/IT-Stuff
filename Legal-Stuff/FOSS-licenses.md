# Overview on FOSS licenses
There is a real large bunch of FOSS licenses available. So finding the best fitting one can be complicated.

Heise published an [article about comparing several models](https://www.heise.de/hintergrund/Kurz-erklaert-Rechtliche-Aspekte-von-FOSS-10031720.html), but according to the comments, it is at best a quick overview that is inaccurate and partially incorrect in detail.

Better *further readings* seems to be:
- A comparing matrix by [Open Source Software Automation Lab (OSADL)](https://www.osadl.org/)
  -  https://www.osadl.org/OSADL-Open-Source-License-Checklists.oss-compliance-lists.0.html
- An overview on (non-)compatible licenses in the scope of the Fedora Project
