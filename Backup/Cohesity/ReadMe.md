# My notes on Cohesity
All notes also fit for *IBM Defender Protect* as it's a *bluepainted* Cohesity Data Protect :-)

- The deployment script for KVM was ... eh ... a bit outdated, so I revised it and fixed a few small bugs and added a query for the selinux setting :-)

- Also I missed a script for deploying the RoBo-VM on Proxmox -- well, [it](./deploy-DP-PVE.sh)'s under development ...
