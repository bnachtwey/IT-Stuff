# Links and Notes on SP Training

## official IBM offerings
IBM has set up an office [training colletion for Storage Protect Administrators](https://www.ibm.com/training/collection/ibm-storage-protect-administrator-893).

Well, it starts with _IBM Storage Foundations_ and comes to SP Fundamnentals and ends with deep dive courses.

Unfortunately,

- it still contains _Storage Protect Plus_ which is end-of sale and deprecated
- The [_Implementation and Administration_](https://www.ibm.com/training/course/ibm-storage-protect-version-8112-implementation-and-administration-TS619G) is a little outdated as it was designed for SP 8.1.12
- The [_Advanced Administration, Tuning, and Troubleshooting_](https://www.ibm.com/training/course/ibm-storage-protect-8113-advanced-administration-tuning-and-troubleshooting-TS629G) course is not much better as it was designed for SP 8.1.13

## you ~~might~~ **should** consider

- Michael Malitz: [TSM / (Spectrum) Storage Protect 8.1.27 Trainings & Technical Infos](https://www.mm-it.at/de/portfolio_courses.html)

  Although Michael is retiering for at least since 2022, he still updates his own course material and therefore addresses all new features coming up :-)

  Besides this, Michael's course are less frontal teaching than like workshops and he is happy to address specific questions from participants.

  **SO, book your course before Michael really retires ;-)**
