# Comments on IBM SP error messages
Although IBM has list of all messages ([Link to SP V8.1.24](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-protect/8.1.24?topic=messages-return-codes-error-codes)) that mainly include descriptions on how to cope with them, the long term experiance shows, there's something _nice2know_ or even _important2know_ on several messages, that's not mentioned in the IBM documentation.

Some of this _addtional knowledge_ addresses some special situations, some allow to do the needed inpretation of the message as they themselves only describe the error very vaguely.

In this section I collect my experiances made and enrich the documentation a little :-)
