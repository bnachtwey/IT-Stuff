# ANR0340E after db2 restore on replication source server (without data loss)
Due to the [IBM Documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/storage-protect/8.1.24?topic=replication-replicating-client-node-data-after-database-restore) *when you restore the IBM Storage Protect database on a source replication server, replication is automatically disabled.*

The documentation describes a task to recover data when you had to do a point-in-time restorem but having lost the logs, so the replication target may contain data that's not refercened in your primary server. Therefore the IBM action plan shows how to first recover this data from the replication target before setting up the regualar replication again.

**But how to cope this error, of no data has lost?**
Perhaps you have moved your server or you do a database restore after an upgrade broke? 
Then there is no need to dissolve the relationship, redefine it inversely, set up a bunch of replication rules, replicate data back, delete either the new rules as the new relationship, redefine the old one again *and* turn it on.

It is then sufficient to simply switch replication back on:
