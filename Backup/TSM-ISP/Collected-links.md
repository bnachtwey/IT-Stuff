# A list of useful links around IBM SP aka TSM

## Information Collections
- Michael Malitz' Homepage **MM IT Consulting**, looks a little confusing, but filled with lots of information still including offers for SP trainings (although IBM has stopped the training programme)<br>

## Trainings
- [Michael Malitz](https://www.mm-it.at/de/portfolio_courses.html) is my favorite "instructor" ... although “workshop leader” is probably a better description as I was called to be “fully trained” and therefore look a constructive, cooperative, but gladly guided exchange instead of standard coachings.

## IBM Github
- [Ansible Playbooks for SP](https://github.com/IBM/ansible-storage-protect) -- just a empty hull by October 2024 -- but, let's see if something will come up
