# Some notes on storing and managing credentials

## Keepass

Unfortunately _Keepass_ does not allow to share credentials with others -- besides setting up dedicated databases and then share the password, so I looked for alternatives

## Bitwarden

looks fine, but

- is an US company so no real _digital souverenity_
- is fully cloud based, no local copies by default

Workarounds
- [How to backup my bitwarden tresor and how to access that backup?](./Bitwarden/HowTo_Backup.md)
- [Automatically backup my bitwarden tresor](./Bitwarden/Automatic_Backup.md)
- [Set up automated Bitwarden exports to a self-hosted Vaultwarden](./Bitwarden/Export2Vaultwarden.md)
