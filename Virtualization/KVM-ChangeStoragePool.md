To change the path for KVM images inside RHEL, follow these steps:

1. Stop all running virtual machines:
```bash
sudo virsh shutdown <vm_name>
```

2. List the current storage pool:
```bash
sudo virsh pool-list
```

3. Stop the default storage pool:
```bash
sudo virsh pool-destroy default
```

4. Edit the default storage pool configuration:
```bash
sudo virsh pool-edit default
```

5. In the XML file, locate the `<path>` element under the `<target>` directive and change it to your desired new path[1][3]. For example:
```xml
<path>/home/vms</path>
```

6. Save and exit the editor.

7. Start the default storage pool with the new path:
```bash
sudo virsh pool-start default
```

8. Verify the new path:
```bash
sudo virsh pool-dumpxml default | grep -i path
```

9. Move existing VM image files to the new location:
```bash
sudo mv /var/lib/libvirt/images/<vm_name>.qcow2 /home/vms/
```

10. Update each VM's configuration to reflect the new image path:
```bash
sudo virsh edit <vm_name>
```
Change the `<source file>` element to point to the new location[2][3].

> [!INFO]
> This may be very extensive work, calling for a `sed` command doing this ;-)

11. Start your virtual machines:
```bash
sudo virsh start <vm_name>
```

Remember to create the new directory before changing the path, and ensure you have sufficient permissions and storage space in the new location[3]. If you encounter SELinux-related issues, you may need to adjust SELinux contexts or temporarily set it to permissive mode[3].
