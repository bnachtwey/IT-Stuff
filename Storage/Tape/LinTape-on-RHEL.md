# Notes on installing LinTape on RHEL
ðŸš§
> [!WARNING]<br>
> IBM is always a litte late, so the newest *LinTape* driver typically does not support the actual RHEL version.
>
> And whenever IBM fixes this, RedHat has released a new version and therefore the problem persists :-(

## Basic installation steps

- get the LinTape package from [IBM FIX CENTRAL](https://www.ibm.com/support/fixcentral/), using **:
  - select as *Product selector*: `Tape device drivers`
  - select as *Platform*: `Linux 64-bit,x86_64`
  - *continue*
  - select the ones you're looking for, e.g. *RHEL9*<br>
