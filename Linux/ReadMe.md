## _Unix-Philosophy on Pipelining_

The principle that ***the output of one Unix tool should be usable as the input for another*** is a core tenet of [Unix philosophy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy). This idea was popularized by [Doug McIlroy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_McIlroy), one of the original developers of Unix at Bell Labs.

McIlroy articulated this concept in the early 1970s, emphasizing the importance of building small, modular programs that do one thing well and can be chained together using pipes. His famous quote is:

    “Write programs that do one thing and do it well. Write programs to work together. Write programs to handle text streams, because that is a universal interface.”

This philosophy led to the creation of powerful command-line tools like grep, awk, sed, and sort, which can be combined in [pipelines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pipeline_(Unix)) to perform complex tasks efficiently.
