# Notes and *Nice2Know* on *OpenMediaVault*

- Installing *OMV* from scratch it always uses *DHCP*, so you need to know it's MAC adress for static IP usage or
- login via console and use `omv-firstaid` to change / set it's IP address
- by default the GUId default user `admin` uses the password `openmediavault`, but sometimes this does not work. You can fix it by running `omv-firstaid` on the console and reset the *Workbench administrator password*<br>
