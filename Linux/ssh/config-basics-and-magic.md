# Some general remarks on `.ssh/config`

> [!TIP]
> the config file is processed *top-down*, so

ðŸš§ I'm still collecting and not sure, which is the best default setting ... ðŸš§

# useful configuration settings
- `include config.d/*` should be places at the top of your local `config` file to read settings for specific hosts first
- `IdentitiesOnly yes` <br>
  Specifies that ssh should only use the configured authentication identity and certificate files (either the default files, or those explicitly configured in the ssh_config files or passed on the ssh(1) command-line), even if ssh-agent(1) or a PKCS11Provider or SecurityKeyProvider offers more identities.  The argument to this keyword must be yes or no (the default).  This option is intended for situations where ssh-agent offers many different identities.
