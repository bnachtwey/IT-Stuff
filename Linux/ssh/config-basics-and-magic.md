# Some general remarks on `.ssh/config`

> [!TIP]
> the config file is processed *top-down*, so
>  - put the `include config.d/*` to the top, processing detailed settings from dedicated files first
>  - put *catch all* statements at the end, so they are processed only if no other, more specific setting was done

ðŸš§ I'm still collecting and not sure, which is the best default setting ... ðŸš§

# useful configuration settings
- `include config.d/*` should be places at the top of your local `config` file to read settings for specific hosts first

example configuration setting, may be 
```
Host <Alias1> [Alias2] [ ... Alias N]`<br>
  Define *Shortnames* or *Aliases* to Access hosts using specific settings
- `HostName <IP-Name or IP-Adress>`<br>
