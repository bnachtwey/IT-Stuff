# Running Microsoft Office Apps on Linux
## The most privacy aware approach
Don't use any Microsoft products at all, don't trust the statement, _Microsoft won't process your data or share it with the agencies_.

Use instead
 | MS product | Altenative |
 | ---------- | ---------- |
 | MS Office  | [Libreoffice](www.libreoffice.org), [Softmaker Office](https://softmaker.de/produkte/softmaker-office) |
 | MS Outlook | [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/), [Evolution](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Evolution)|
## The most simple approach: Use the WebApps
Of course, the easiest way is not to install the Apps, but run them as WebbApp in the Azure Cloud. Unfortunately, with this approach, Microsoft get *full control* on your personal and perhaps also private data -- do so, _if you've nothing not to share with the public..._ 

## Trying to have some controll: do a local install
As long as there are still _on-prem versions_ of Microsoft Office, you can install them using [wine](https://www.winehq.org/).
