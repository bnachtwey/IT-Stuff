# AI attribution for improved transparency

Due to (https://aiattribution.github.io/):

_An attribution statement identifies not only the presence of AI involvement, but also how AI was used. This approach makes important distinctions between different types and amounts of AI contributions, allowing creators to maintain ownership over co-created work and consumers to calibrate their trust._

## Some Basic AIA codes
