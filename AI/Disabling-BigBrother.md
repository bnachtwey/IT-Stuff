# Disabling BigBrother aka AI 
The *hottest AI shice* is not welcome to everybody. And as some people cannot be *convinced to share their most private data with BigTech*, some force is used added and enabling such "features" by default.

Furtunately, there are still some tools which violate the basic principle of ‚ÄúPrivacy-by-Default (PbD)‚Äù, but still allow such functions to be switched off.

## Apple Siri
- Starting with iOS 18 you cannot disable Siri completely if you still want to use *Apple CarPlay* ü§Æ
  - As a workaround you may limit the access to Siri *on pressing the side button only*
## Mozilla
